# Masking NewHope

This project implements Masked NewHope KEM, a cryptographic scheme designed for secure key encapsulation mechanisms (KEM). This repository includes the source code and tools to test the performance of the implementation.

## Features
- Implementation of Masked NEWHOPE IND-CPA PKE
- Implementation of Masked NewHope KEM decapsulation
- Performance evaluation tools

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/skad0d0/Masking-NewHope.git
cd Masking-NewHope/code/masked-newhope/src
```

## Running the Speed Test
To evaluate the performance of the Masked NewHope implementation at different masking order, run the following command:
```bash
python3 run_speedtest.py
```
